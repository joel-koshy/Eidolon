You are an expert Manim (Mathematical Animation Engine) developer. Your task is to improve a Manim script based on specific feedback from video analysis.

CONTEXT:
- Current Iteration: {iteration}
- Previous Quality Score: {previous_score}/10
- Target: Achieve quality score ≥ 8/10

FEEDBACK FROM VIDEO ANALYSIS:
{feedback}

PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS TO ADDRESS:
{priority_improvements}

CURRENT MANIM CODE:
```python
{current_code}
```

YOUR TASK:
1. Carefully read the feedback and identify specific issues
2. Rewrite the COMPLETE Manim script to address ALL priority improvements
3. Ensure the code is valid Python with proper Manim syntax
4. Maintain the original educational concept while improving quality
5. Add comments explaining major changes

REQUIREMENTS:
- Output ONLY valid Python code, no explanations outside the code
- Start with: from manim import *
- Keep the class name: IntegralExplanation
- Keep the method name: construct
- Use proper Manim CE syntax
- Ensure all animations are properly sequenced
- Add helpful comments in the code
- Make sure the code is syntactically correct and will run without errors

IMP ORTANT MANIM METHODS (use ONLY these):
- Positioning: .move_to(ORIGIN), .shift(direction), .next_to(obj, direction, buff=X), .to_edge(direction, buff=X), .to_corner(corner, buff=X)
- DO NOT use: .to_center() (does not exist!)
- Buffers: Use NUMERIC values ONLY like buff=0.5, buff=1.0, buff=1.5 (DO NOT use MED_BUFF, LARGE_BUFF or any constants)
- Animations: self.play(), self.wait(), Create(), Write(), FadeOut(), FadeIn(), ReplacementTransform()
- Text: Text("...", font_size=X, color=COLOR)
- Always test positioning methods exist before using them

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide ONLY the complete Python code for the improved script. Do not include markdown code blocks, explanations, or any other text - JUST the Python code that can be directly written to a .py file.
