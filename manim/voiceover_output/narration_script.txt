How do we find the exact area under this curve?

So, let's *try* to fill this shape with rectangles.

As you can see... it's not very good.

But what if we use *more* rectangles?

Let's keep going. We'll use more... and more...

...our approximation becomes... *exact*.

This process... is called integration.

This symbol... is a stretched-out 'S', for 'Sum'.

...and this dx represents the *infinitely thin* width...

Integral = Exact Area.
